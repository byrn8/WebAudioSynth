        Filter
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 420px);">
        The Filter is the part of the synthesizer that alters the timbre of the sound.
        It does this after it has recieved the sine wave from the Amplitude Envelope and
        also after it has received the values from the Frequency Envelope. The three
        parts that make up the Filter are: The Q Value, Rolloff, and Filter Type.
        The image below shows what the Filter looks like on the synthesizer.

      <div id="mage" style="top:calc(50% - 380px);">

        Q
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 320px);">
        Speaking technically, the Q value is responsible for affecting the quality
        of the filter (hence the Q). To put it in understandable terms, the Q value
        is the part of the synthesizer that affects the 'wah' or 'wub'. This may help
        you understand a bit better what the value actually does but the best to get
        a grasp of this is to just experiment with it and see where it takes you. Do
        be wary though as the more you increase the Q value, the louder the sound is
        most likely going to be and take extreme caution when playing with the Q value
        when the rolloff is '-48' or '-96' as it effectively turns the synthesizer
        into a noise generator.
      </div>
      <div id="header" style="top:calc(50% - 280px);">
        Rolloff
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 260px);">
        The Rolloff is responsible for affecting the frequency of the notes played.
        technically speaking it alters the drop in decibels according to the octave.
        It's mainly used in real syntehsizers to alter the sound of low and high but
        as this isn't a full fleshed out synthesizer it's capabilities are limited.
        As with most of the other elements, the best way to understand how it affects
        the sound is to experiment with it. As was mentioned in the Q section, the lower
        the rolloff value the louder the sound is on the lower notes.
      </div>
      <div id="header" style="top:calc(50% - 220px);">
        Filter Type
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 200px);">
        The different Filter Types are responsible for changing the frequency of the
        sound over time. For example, the default 'lowpass' filter type will start of
        at a low frequency and then gradually rise with time and the 'highpass' flter
        type does the exact opposite of this. Other types include the 'notch' type
        which starts of high, falls, then rises again. Like with most of the options
        on the synthesizer, experimentation is your friend and playing with the different
        options will give you an idea of what they do.
