        Frequency Envelope
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 420px);">
        The Frequency Envelope is the other envelope that is responsible for the
        alteration of the filter this time instead of the oscillator.
        The Frequency Envelope is composed of 4 main parts: Attack, Decay,
        Sustain, and Release. Each of these elements are responsible for different things
        and they will be explained in great detail in the coming subsections. The image
        below shows what the Frequency Envelope looks like on the synthesizer. As the
        fundamentals of both the Amplitude Envelope and the Frequency Envelope are the
        same, most of the information on this page will be the same as the Amplitude Envelope
        page so if you have read that page it might be best to skip this one.

        Attack
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 320px);">
        The attack value is measured from a range of 0 to 2 and is responsible for
        determining the time in which the sine wave reaches it's maximum point
        (or volume to put it in simpler terms). In ADSR envelopes, the attack is the
        first value that is calculated and applied to the sine wave. The diagram below
        should give a better understanding of what the attack is responsible for in sound.

      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 270px);">
        Having a low attack value means that the sound that is produced will reach
        peak volume releatively quickly meaning that it will sound more 'immediate'
        to the ear. Having a high attack value means the complete opposite will occur
        and the sound will sound less 'immediate' and will gradually fade in and grow
        in volume until it reaches it's peak point later on. Playing around with the attack
        for any period of time should give most people a pretty good idea of how it can
        affect the final output of the sound as the difference between the low and
        high values are quite drastic. With that being said, the attack is one of the
        easier envelope elements to understand and ones such as decay can be a lot
        harder to grasp when just playing around with the synthesizer.
      </div>
      <div id="header" style="top:calc(50% - 250px);">
        Decay
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 240px);">
        The decay value is also measured from a range of 0 to 2 and is responsible
        for determining the time between the end of the attack and the beginning of
        the sustain. In other words it is used as a kind of 'dropoff' value that
        calculates how fast the sine wave will drop in frequency. The decay is the
        second value of the ADSR ennvelope as you may have already guessed. The diagram
        below should give a better understanding of what the attack is responsible for
        in sound.
      </div>
      <div id="mage" style="top:calc(50% - 220px);">
        <img src="img/Decay.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">
      </div>
      <div id="footnote" style="top:calc(50% - 210px);">
        Image Source: Tone.js
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 190px);">
        When the decay is set to a low value on the synthesizer the sound that it
        produced will suddenly 'dropoff' drastically right after the attack has reached
        it's peak and will produce a kind of audibile 'clipping' sound that is made
        because the time between the attack and sustain is so low. When the value is
        set high the transition between the attack and the sustain will be much smoother
        as the time will be increased. To get the best understanding of what the decay
        value does audibly, set both of the attack values to 1.0 and the play around
        with the decay values as when the attack is set too low the decay can be quite
        hard to hear even when the values go from 0 to 2.
      </div>
      <div id="header" style="top:calc(50% - 170px);">
        Sustain
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 160px);">
        The sustain value is measured from a range of 0 to 1 and is responsible for
        determining the time at which the sound of the sine wave 'rests' or 'sustains'.
        The sustain is used when you want to specify how long the mid point of the sine
        wave or sound to carry on for after the end of the decay period. The sustain is
        the third value of the ADSR envelope that is calculated right after the attack and
        decay. The diagram below should give a better understanding of what the attack
        is responsible for in sound.
      </div>
      <div id="mage" style="top:calc(50% - 140px);">
        <img src="img/Sustain.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">
      </div>
      <div id="footnote" style="top:calc(50% - 130px);">
        Image Source: Tone.js
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 110px);">
        While it is pretty self explanatory, the lower you put the sustain value,
        the shorter the time of the midpoint of the sine wave will be and the higher
        you put the value the longer the midpoint will last. Getting a feel for how
        the sustain affects the sound is fairly simple as regardless pf the other 3
        values, the sustain will always have an audible impact on the sound.
      </div>
      <div id="header" style="top:calc(50% - 90px);">
        Release
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 80px);">
        The release value is measured from a range of 0 to 5 and is responsible for
        determining the time between the end of the sustain to the lowest point of
        the sine wave (which is also the point at which the sound or sine wave ends).
        The release is the final value of the ADSR envelope and is happens right after
        the sustain to the end of the sound. The diagram below should give a better
        understanding of what the attack is responsible for in sound.
      </div>
      <div id="mage" style="top:calc(50% - 60px);">
        <img src="img/Release.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">
      </div>
      <div id="footnote" style="top:calc(50% - 50px);">
        Image Source: Tone.js
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 30px);">
        Fundamentaly, the release value acts in the exact same way as the decay value
        does except that instead of happening between the attack and sustain it happens
        between the sustain and end of the sine wave. The lower the release value, the
        shorter the time is between the end of the sustain and the end of the sound and
        the higher the value the longer the time will be. The 'clipping' that was
        mentioned in the decay section also happens to the release value as well if
        it is set too low. The release is also very easy to get a grasp of when trying
        to hear the audibile differences as it happens right at the end of the sounds
        lifecycle so just playing with the values will give you an idea of how the release
        value works.
      </div>
      <div id="header" style="top:calc(50% - 10px);">
        Curves
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 0px);">
        The final element that makes up both of the envelopes is the curves for the attack,
        decay, and release values. The curves are the dropdown menus at the top of each
        of the respective elements that changes the way they act. Most of the curve
        types are fairly self explanatory but to give a bot of context, the curves
        essentially affect the way the elements get from point A to point B. If you're
        familiar with the terms 'linear' and 'exponential' then i'm sure you will gain
        understanding just from messing around with the different options as most of them
        are quite distinct from one another (especially the attack curves).
