        Welcome to the --- Synthesizer Instruction Manual. On these pages you will find
        the various pieces of documentation that will help teach you about the different
        elements of the synthesizer as well as how to use the it. You can use the
        header links at the top of the page to navigate to the instructions page for
        the different parts of the synthesizer. There is also a button in the top right
        of the header that will allow you to go back to the Synthesizer environment
        as well.

        A Brief Introduction to Synthesizers
      </div>
      <div id="para" style="top:calc(50% - 350px);">
        As synthesizers can be somewhat of a niche instrument to be into, a brief
        explanation will be given on what they actually do and how they can be used.
        As the synthesizer that has been developed is a digital one made through the
        use of web audio frameworks, the explanation of functionality will be referencing
        these types of synthesizers and not the traditional analog synthesizers
        and sound synthesis techniques. At it's core, a synthesizer generates sound
        by the use of sine waves. These sine waves are created in an oscillator and
        from here the signal is sent through the envelopes and filter. These are
        responsible for changing the sound and characteristics of the sine wave and
        as well as other things like volume, pitch, and frequency. After this the sine
        wave is sent to the output and plays the synthesised sound. The chart below will
        demonstrate how this occurs.

        In terms of their practical use, synthesizers in the last 50 years have quickly
        become one of the most popular instruments used in modern music. As they pretty
        much have near endless possibilities for the types of sound they can create,
        it's no wonder they have become so ubiquitous in the music scene. And that is
        one of the many reasons that this project was made in the first place. To show
        people what even the most simple synthesizers can do and to educate them on how
        they do wehatv they do.
